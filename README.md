# Overview
For my third milestone project I have chose to do a videogame review website. On this website one can view reviews, add reviews,
add gaming platforms and also delete reviews. At the moment anybody using the site can delete reviews but at a later stage 
this would be changed to allow only admins of the site to delete reviews. There is a 'Top Rated' option in the navigation bar
which, upon clicked, will show to user the ten most top rated games within the game reviews collection.

# UX
This website is designed for fans of videogames. It is designed to allow videogame users to choose their next videogame to play
by showing reviews left by other videogame fans. If a videogame player has an opinion on a particular game which they have played,
they can choose to review the videogame which is posted to the site.
